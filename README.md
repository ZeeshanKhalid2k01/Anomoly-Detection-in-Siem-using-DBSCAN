# Anomoly-Detection-in-Siem-using-DBSCAN
1) anomaly detection 2) rare event 3) dbscan 4) elastic search 5)kibana 6) API handling 7) calling Elastic Search for new DB 8) Send results to elastic Search

#note (Method to run code & Imp INstructions):
1) change IP to original Elastic Search IP
2) change the Siem Table name to its original table name
3) If you are running the first time, then ok, because SQL DB and time log will be self-created
4) if your database of elastic search has been deleted and time logs are calling previous logs, then an error came, you need to manually change the time log because its a rare event
5) Run Siem file.py to get and throw back results to elastic search
6) if Siem file.py is successfully running, then you can automate the script using app_run.py
